jumperIndex = Regex.Match(CheckedListBoxCurrent. Items. Item( count),
findNumbers).Value - 1
again the - 1 above is beacuse the list of all jumbers works with a 0
based list, if there wasnt a - 1 then on each update click all the jumpers ids would
increase by one.
LocalcontactRelations.Add(Localalljumpers. Item(jumperIndex))
Next
this calls the function within the parent form, passing the updated local
contact relations through
UpdateCallBack(LocalcontactRelations)
'after this function the code can run indapendantly still, the callback
function is run, then the code runs here after.
